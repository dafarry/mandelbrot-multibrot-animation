Although I've put a CC by 3.0 license notification in the video
itself that's been uploaded elsewhere because of the added
licensed music file (the text is generated by the
Bash script add-credits.sh), I don't care what you do with the
source code here so that's public domain. Adjust the text in the
add-credits.sh script to suit yourself if you use that.
Obviously, if you add a licensed music file as I did, then you'll
need to add an appropriate credit for that.
